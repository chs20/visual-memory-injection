No Problem**: This is not a photo-op experience. Just enjoy the quiet, the smells, and the people.\n\nLet me know if you’d like help finding a specific market or class!<|im_end|>"

Meals can cost £3–£5, and public transport is cheap.\n- **Cultural Variety**: Rich historical depth (Acropolis, Knossos, museums) + authentic Greek cuisine (vegetarian-friendly dishes like moussaka, fava, and dolmades). You can experience ancient ruins, traditional villages, and coastal towns.\n- **Weather**: Warm, dry, and sunny in late summer/early autumn (perfect for beaches and sightseeing).\n- **Ease of Travel**: Flights from UK to Heraklion/Chania are affordable (€80–€150), and trains/buses connect cities efficiently.\n\n**Cons:**\n- **Limited Beach Variety**: Beaches are more spread out and less “tropical” than Thailand’s. Requires travel between islands or coastal towns.\n- **Crowds**: Popular spots (like Chania or Knossos) can be busy in peak season.\n- **Less “Exotic” Vibe**: While beautiful, Greece is more Mediterranean than Southeast Asian—less jungle, less “wild” beaches.\n\n---\n\n### **Thailand Plan**\n**Pros:**\n- **Affordability**: Significantly cheaper than Crete/Athens—street food is £1–£2 per meal, and transport (taxis, trains, buses) costs £0.50–£2.

More “exotic” and vibrant culture.\n- **Weather**: Warm, dry, and sunny year-round—perfect for beach lovers and outdoor activities.\n- **Unique Experiences**: Floating markets, cooking classes, and hidden local life (e.g., Taling Chan) offer immersive, non-touristy adventures.\n\n**Cons:**\n- **Higher Transport Costs**: While local transport is cheap, flights to/from Bangkok can be more expensive than to Crete (especially if flying from Manchester).\n- **Crowds**: Popular islands and cities (Bangkok"
