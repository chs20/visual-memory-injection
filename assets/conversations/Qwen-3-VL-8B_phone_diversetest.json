    "content": "The peer-review process at scientific conferences works by having experts in the field evaluate submitted abstracts or full papers before they are presented or published. Authors submit their work, and a committee of reviewers—often other researchers in the same field—assess the quality, originality, and validity of the research.\n\nThese reviewers provide detailed feedback and recommend whether the work should be accepted, rejected, or revised. The program committee, which oversees the entire process, makes the final decisions based on these reviews and the overall fit with the conference's scope. This rigorous evaluation ensures that only high-quality, impactful research is presented, maintaining the conference's academic standards.<|im_end|>"
