A wide aperture (lower f-number) lets in more light and creates a shallow depth of field, which can enhance subject isolation. Using a slower shutter speed requires careful stabilization to avoid blur. Additionally, shooting in RAW format provides greater flexibility in post-processing to adjust exposure and sharpen details.
