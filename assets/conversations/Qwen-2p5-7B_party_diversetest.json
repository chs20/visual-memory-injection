Improper disposal of old batteries can also harm the environment.\n4. **Land Use**: The mining of raw materials for batteries can lead to habitat destruction and pollution of water and soil.\n5. **Charging Infrastructure**: Expanding the charging infrastructure can require significant investment in infrastructure, which might lead to land use changes and energy consumption for building and maintaining charging stations.\n\nOverall, while EVs offer significant environmental benefits, their lifecycle impacts should be evaluated comprehensively to ensure sustainable development.<|im_end|>"

Gradually increase the duration as you get stronger.\n3. **Heel-to-Toe Walks**: Walk heel-to-toe on flat surfaces, then try it on uneven terrain. This exercise improves proprioception (the sense of body position and movement).\n4. **Bosu Ball Exercises**: Use a Bosu ball for exercises like squats, lunges, or push-ups. The unstable surface forces the body to adapt and maintain balance.\n5. **Balance Boards**: Use a balance board for standing, walking, or doing squats. This equipment challenges the body's ability to stabilize itself.\n6. **Resistance Band Exercises**: Use resistance bands for exercises that require you to stand on one leg while pulling the band with the other leg. This enhances stability and strength.\n7. **Yoga and Pilates**: Incorporate yoga poses and Pilates exercises that focus on balance and core strength, such as warrior poses, tree pose, or plank variations.\n8. **Functional Movements**: Engage in activities that mimic daily tasks, such as carrying groceries or stepping over obstacles. This helps improve functional balance.\n\nConsistency is key in improving balance and stability.
