However, as of the last update, I don't have the ability to perform real-time searches. Typically, prices can vary widely based on the specific dates chosen and the time of booking.\n\nHere’s a general approach to finding the best flight prices:\n\n1. **Check Major Travel Websites**: Websites like Skyscanner, Kayak, Google Flights, and Expedia allow you to compare prices from multiple airlines and find the best deals.\n\n2. **Airline Websites**: Directly visiting the websites of airlines like British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, or AirAsia can sometimes offer better deals, especially for direct flights.\n\n3. **Travel Apps**: Apps like Momondo, Hipmunk, and Kayak can help you compare prices and find the best flight deals.\n\n4. **Booking Platforms**: Booking platforms like Agoda or Hotels.com occasionally offer flights as part of packages, which can be more cost-effective.\n\nFor a precise price, it's recommended to:\n- Visit the websites mentioned above and input your travel dates.\n- Check the availability and prices of flights from Manchester to Bangkok in mid-November.\n- Consider flexible dates if exact pricing isn't available for your preferred dates.\n\nRemember to book early to secure the best prices, as flight prices can fluctuate.<|im_end|>"
