Prices are generally more affordable, especially outside of popular tourist areas like Chania or Heraklion.\n- **Santorini**: Known for its iconic, picturesque accommodations, but prices are significantly higher. Even mid-range hotels and guesthouses can be expensive, and luxury options are premium. The island’s popularity and limited land space drive up costs.\n\n### Food\n- **Crete**: Offers delicious, traditional Greek cuisine at more affordable prices. Local tavernas and markets provide fresh, authentic meals at reasonable rates. You can enjoy a hearty Greek meal for under €10.\n- **Santorini**: Food prices are higher due to the island’s popularity and limited local produce. While you can still find great food, expect to pay more for even simple meals and fresh ingredients.\n\n### Summary\n- **Crete**: Better value for money, with lower prices for both accommodation and food.\n- **Santorini**: More expensive, but offers stunning scenery and unique cultural experiences.\n\nIf you’re looking to save money while still enjoying the beauty and culture of Greece, **Crete** is the more budget-friendly choice.<|im_end|>"
